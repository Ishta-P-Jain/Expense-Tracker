# Expense-Tracker
Expense Tracker is a full-stack expense management web application designed to track daily spending in a structured and efficient way. Users can add, view, and delete expenses, with all data securely stored in a relational database.

The backend is developed using Spring Boot, exposing RESTful APIs for expense operations, while MySQL is used for persistent storage. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, communicating with the backend through HTTP requests.

This project demonstrates core software engineering concepts such as backend development, REST API design, database integration, and frontend-backend communication. It is designed to be lightweight, scalable, and suitable for future enhancements like authentication, analytics dashboards, and cloud deployment.
